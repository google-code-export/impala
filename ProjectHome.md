Impala is a **dynamic modular productivity framework** for Java-based web applications, based on the [Spring Framework](http://www.springframework.org).
With a focus on simplicity, Impala radically transforms application development using Spring and all the usual related technologies.

With it's powerful **dynamic reloading** capability, Impala dramatically reduces build/deploy/test cycles, allowing you to spend more time coding and less time waiting for your application to reload.

Unlike other Spring modularity projects, Impala does not depend on any third party runtime environments. Instead, it offers offers a **simple, powerful and cohesive environment** for truly modular application development and deployment that just works out of the box.

## What makes Impala different? ##
  * you can **dynamically reload** the parts of your application that have changed
  * you can **dynamically select** the parts you want to deploy
  * you can structure your application in a **modular** way
  * you can **kickstart** your project in a few easy steps
  * you can still do it in **Java**
  * you can use the powerful but still familiar Spring programming model
  * you can fine tune your Spring config **painlessly**, even for complex apps
  * you can free yourself from application context XML hell!
  * you can do it all on for web apps using **Spring** MVC
  * or you can use your favourite Java web framework
  * you can develop in an **interactive, TDD-friendly** way
  * you can write full **integration test suites** that execute in seconds, not minutes
  * you can build your application without having to write your own **build** scripts
  * you can pull your dependencies directly from a Maven repository
  * but otherwise you don't actually need to use Maven, although you can if you want to!
  * you can develop your application entirely **within your IDE**
  * but you don't need to install any IDE plugins!

## Overview ##

Impala allows you to divide a large Spring-based application into a hierarchy of modules. These modules can be dynamically added, updated or removed.

Because Impala-based applications are genuinely modular, they are much easier to maintain than vanilla Spring applications.

Impala radically boosts productivity of Spring application development. This is enabled by the dynamic module loading capability, the seamless integration with Eclipse, and the efficient mechanisms for running Spring integration tests, both individually and within suites. When writing applications you only rarely need to restart your JVM, allowing your application changes to be reflected almost instantly. No long restart waits required!

Impala also features a build system, based on ANT, and dependency management capabilities, which you can optionally use.
